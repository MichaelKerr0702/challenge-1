## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation behind this project was to take a code file of html and CSS and clean up the previous code that was there while also reorginizing the webpage.
- The problem we solved was to make it easier to update this website or even go back and clean up the code some more by adding comments to understand what is happening on the webpage
- I learned to read though the html and CSS code to understand what all of the elements meant while learning what clean code should look like with comments and using DRY to not repeat yourself
